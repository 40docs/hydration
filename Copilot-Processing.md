# Copilot Processing Log

## User Request
Prune local branches that are not on the remote

## Request Analysis
- User wants to clean up local Git branches that no longer exist on the remote repository
- This is a common Git maintenance task to keep the local repository clean
- Current working directory appears to be infrastructure repo based on terminal context
- Need to identify which repository the user wants to clean up (infrastructure or hydration)

## Context
- User is currently viewing pr_body_temp.md in hydration directory
- Terminal working directory shows infrastructure repo
- User has been working across both infrastructure and hydration repositories
- Recent work involved committing changes and creating PRs

## Action Plan
1. Check current repository and branch status
2. Fetch latest changes from remote with pruning
3. Identify local branches with "gone" remote tracking
4. Delete local branches that no longer exist on remote
5. Verify cleanup and check other repositories

## Execution Results

### Infrastructure Repository
- ✅ Fetched with --prune, removed 8 stale remote tracking branches
- ✅ Identified 2 local branches with [gone] status:
  - feature/add-az-login-workflow
  - fix/cloudshell-index-out-of-range
- ✅ Successfully deleted both local branches
- ✅ Repository now clean with only main branch

### Hydration Repository
- ✅ Checked branch status
- ✅ All branches have valid remote tracking:
  - feature/improve-hydration-config (ahead 1)
  - feature/logo-upload (exists on remote)
  - main (ahead 2)
- ✅ No pruning needed

## Summary
Successfully pruned local branches from infrastructure repository. Removed 2 local branches that no longer exist on the remote. Hydration repository was already clean.
